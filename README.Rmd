## Analysis of Strava Data with a Shiny App

The goal of ericstrava is to develop a Shiny App, in a package structure, which allows for simple analysis of Eric's Strava data.

## Installation

You can install ericstrava like so:

``` {r install, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github(repo = "esimms999/ericstrava")
library("ericstrava")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, eval = FALSE}
library(ericstrava)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.

```{r creation_datetime, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
cat("<div align='right'>Created: ", format(Sys.time(), '%Y-%m-%d %X %Z'), "</div>")
```
